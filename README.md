# Tcf7l2-binding
This paper stores all of the code required to run the Tcf7l2 binding test.

To run this code, download the RData file and the R scripts. Insure that your mouse data is a list of gene symbols. Other gene naming types (e.g. ENSEMBL, ENTREZ...). I reccommend using BioMart to convert these gene names but anything should work. Also these experiments only work with mouse data and could be generalized to any TF. if you are interested in doing this then e-mail me at djsokolowski95-at-gmail-dot-com.
